# OCR-Script
This program is a simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR) script in Python. It uses the libraries os, pytesseract and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

Use:
Ask the user to supply a directory and all supported image files in the directory are OCR'd and there is a .txt file created contains the same name as the image filename.

Instructions:
1. Install Tesseract by following the instructions on their official website https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
2. Add .exe location to PATH (for me it was C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR )
3. pip install pytesseract
